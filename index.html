    <h2>Discovering Your Inner Beauty</h2>
    <p>It's common for people to go to great lengths and expense in the pursuit of beauty. Cosmetics, fashion and even the medical industry vie for your attention and dollars. There are a million ways to enhance your physical beauty. How much will it cost? Will you ever be satisfied? Will you really feel more beautiful? Following are a series of suggestions that offer a holistic and spiritual approach to the more beautiful you.

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. You may be a brunette with an eye on a guy who only likes blondes. The Kayan Lahwi tribe in Thailand reveres women with elongated necks, stretched with brass rings over a lifetime. There are plenty of people who believe Jersey Shore girls have got it going on while others like classic, elegant and understated or conservative style. An endless array of looks and levels of style live in between extremes. External beauty is widely interpreted. It's helpful to accept that, based on this, you will never be beautiful to everyone. A standard of physical beauty across all cultures is nonexistent.

But the definition of interior beauty is universal. A good heart and a kind soul always trumps a dark and brooding nature. Who do you prefer to spend time with? Someone who laughs or someone who complains? What do you project to friends, family and the world? The expression of your heart and soul is as obvious as your freshly shellacked fingernails and little black dress.

Check your watch. The time is now. The past is over and tomorrow may never come. All that you have and all that you can control is right here and right now. You can choose to be beautiful and let our beauty tips put roses in your cheeks and lightness in your step. You do not need a day spa to feel beautiful today.

To be truly beautiful, you must first open your eyes and invite beauty into your life. Every moment offers a choice. With so many pressures upon us, we are easily distracted. Text messages fly fast. Phones ring and emails pile up. Your eyes are dry from staring at glowing screens of smart phones, laptops, desktops and tablets. Look up and unplug - the world can change. Beauty is free, but with a catch. Beauty is an invitation you must accept. Open your eyes and your heart and welcome beauty into your life. Just listen to you.

    <h2>Travel for your mind and body's health</h2>
    <p>Vacation and relaxation go hand-in-hand. Everyone needs time away from the office to rejuvenate. Studies show travel does reduce stress. It also improves our ability to handle stress long after we return home. Studies also show decreased stress in travelers had lower levels of stress hormones.

The benefits of travel and the resulting traveler’s high extend into the workplace as well. Employees who travel have lower rates of absenteeism, higher productivity levels, and generally report feeling less burnt out.

Travel is a learning experience. The new cultures, cuisines, sights, and sounds provide countless opportunities to experience and learn something new. Just being in another country increases the traveler’s knowledge and intercultural awareness.

Travel also helps students learn more. Studies show students who travel earn better grades than their peers who stay at home. These students also have stronger academic interests and more personal confidence. Students who travel abroad are almost twice as likely to complete a college degree.
Travel has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease. A nine-year study of 12,000 men found that those who took at least one vacation per year were 30% less likely to die from heart disease. Another study showed individuals who didn’t take a vacation were twice as likely to have a heart attack.

Travel is also linked to a lower risk of depression. A 2005 study showed significantly decreased risk of depression among 15,000 women.

  <h2>Love Yourself enough to lead a healthy lifestyle</h2>
  <p> Living a healthy lifestyle may mean something different from one person to the next. For some, health is defined by living a disease-free life. For others, healthy is being able to play with grandchildren or perhaps adhering to a weekly exercise schedule. Though the definition of healthy may differ between people, living a healthy lifestyle is a fundamental component to achieving your optimal mental and physical well-being.An inactive lifestyle is a prominent cause for chronic diseases. Fortunately, many of these conditions are manageable and can be prevented by engaging in physical activity most days of the week and by being mindful of your food and lifestyle choices. Your diet also impacts your risk of developing diabetes. In a hallmark 16-year study published in March 2001 by "The New England Journal of Medicine," participants who maintained a body mass index of 25 or less were found to have a significantly lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes compared to people with higher BMIs. Diets high in saturated fat, sugar and processed foods will quickly lead to added pounds. Being overweight increases your risk for high blood pressure, arthritis and certain forms of cancer.

Focusing on a healthy lifestyle not only improves your quality of life, but it may add years as well. Authors of a June 2002 article published by the "American Journal of Public Health" concluded that smoking cessation before age 35 adds 6 to 8 years of life, while quitting at age 65 still adds 1 to 4 years of life expectancy. Being mindful of your diet, physical activity and stress levels allows you to effectively balance all aspects of your life and might increase your life span. Maintaining regular physical examinations aids with early detection and treatment of medical conditions. In addition, your doctor can recommend lifestyle habits that contribute to a longer and healthier life.Learning how to effectively deal with stress plays a significant role in maintaining your health. In a September 2012 article published by "Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine," the authors concluded that leading a healthy lifestyle by engaging in regular physical activity and eating a balanced diet promotes low levels of stress, especially in women. Finding ways to release anxiety and handle daily pressures can keep stress levels low. Some people find participating in yoga or breathing techniques each morning helps them mentally prepare for the day ahead. Spending a few minutes in thoughtful reflection before going to bed may help improve your quality of sleep. And regular exercise increases your brain's ability to memorize and learn.</p>
